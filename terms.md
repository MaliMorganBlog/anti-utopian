Terminology
-----------

Words are used in different ways. Here's how I see it right now: 

- Socialism: A mode of production after capitalism intended to end the rule of the capitalists by making them non-existent as a class. There are different types of socialism, some of which still retain forms of market relations. 
- Socialist: Someone who believes in replacing capitalism with socialism, typically either through reform, revolution, or a combination of both. 
- Communism(1) / "Full" or "High" Communism: A mode of production with no state, no classes, and no money. 
- Communism(2): Historically, a society led by communists.
- Communism(3) / "Primitive" Communism: An ancient mode of production with no state, classes, money. 
- Communist(1): Someone who believes in the possibility of communism(1).
- Communist(2): Someone who upholds the historical struggle for communism. 
- Communist(3): A member of a communist party.
