This is a piece on why you think "Communism is a failed experiment." I've had trouble figuring out how to write this one because there are so many different ways to start talking about this. I'll try this approach:

**"Communism is a failed experiment."**

First, let's attack the word "experiment" in this context. The implication of this word is that as a global society, we are united in our struggles for a better world. It implies we've made a collective decision to try out some of that communism stuff, and see how it works out. This is perhaps the height of idealism. In any class society, the dominant/ruling class makes the decisions and those decisions will be for their own interests, in general. The oppressed classes struggle against the system and sometimes gain some ground or even have a revolution. 

The other problem with thinking of it as an experiment is that it's so difficult to interpret results. The examples of actually existing socialism are so essentially politicized that there's a lot of difficulty figuring out where the successes and failures actually are. Since capitalism has "won", and the winners write the history books, I tend to assume some degree of anti-communist bias from sources. I don't (yet?) know how to figure out the degree of bias.

Let's try rephrasing that sentence so we can be more comfortable with it.

**"Communism has failed."**

Great! Now, let's attack the idea that it has, in fact, "failed!" Why do you think it has failed? Have you studied the living conditions of the average individual before, during, and after communist states? Perhaps you just live in a culture where communism is a recurring joke on TV shows, and you learned about the USSR from a single history book for a week of 6th grade. It seems the modern tactic of bemused dismissal has worked a lot better than the well-known tactics of the McCarthy era.

Instead of citing statistics (for now), let's talk about something central to Marxism: material context. Saying that communism or any other system "has failed" is stripping it of its context.

Here's some context that I think is important in evaluating the USSR. World War 1. Russian civil war. World War 2. Weather-induced famines. Economic pressure and invasian attempts by capitalist countries. The challenge of building an effective state from scratch.

The material conditions of the time caused the USSR to enter the mode of "war communism" in the name of protecting the revolution. The repression of the bourgeoisie and other counter-revolutionary classes was deemed necessary to avoid a coup. History is complicated, basically.

Despite these things, the life expectancy at birth went from ~32 years pre-revolution to 68 years by 1958. Literacy went from 28% pre-revolution to 75% by 1937. The USSR was, of course, the only global superpower other than the United States. 

Anyway, here's the sentence phrased in a way that satisfies me a bit more, even if I disagree with it.

**"Communism is not generally successful, even in its proper context."**

Okay, now here's an assertion we can start a debate about! Well, almost. Can we just change "Communism is not" to "Communism, in its historical forms, was not"? The body of theory on the topic of communism has evolved over the past 150 years significantly, mostly in reaction to what has and hasn't worked. Marx created a theoretical apparatus (historical materialism and dialectical materialism) which was termed Marxism. Lenin's revolutionary success in Russia was due to his adoption of Marxism and adding some concepts about imperialism and the vanguard party. Thus, Marxism-Leninism. Mao added more ideas to the body, including the mass line and the people's war.

So:

**"Communism, in its historical forms, was not generally successful, even in its proper context."**

Alright, now I'm satisfied with the topic of the debate.
