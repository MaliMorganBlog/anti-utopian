My First Worldview
------------------

For a long time, I thought I was apolitical. I thought my interpretation of the world was *neutral* when in fact it was just *default* or *mainstream.* I'm certain many Americans share these beliefs, so they're probably useful to criticize. 

In my opinion, the most important problem that mainstream thought has is idealism. Idealism is a broad set of concepts, but is generally the belief that the world is built on ideas, and the best ideas win out and are subsequently materialized. Politicians, for example, love speaking idealistically. They tend to claim or imply that experts and policy makers all sit in a room together and figure out the best plan for everyone. At their most cynical, they will admit that there exists a bit of a struggle between Republicans and Democrats, but they will reach "across the aisle" to find "non-partisan" solutions to problems.

I'd like to argue that the struggle between professional politicians in the Democratic party and professional politicians in the Republican party does not approach the scale of the real struggles in society. Struggle in society occurs when fundamental interests do not align. I think that the most fundamental interests in society relate to how you spend your working time, how you get food and shelter, the nature of your social life, how much free time you have to pursue your interests, etc. Under capitalism, this manifests as your relationship to wealth. A worker's interests relate to selling his labor power to a capitalist so he can buy food, pay rent, and so on. A capitalist's interests relate to maximizing profit and surviving against the competition. There is much nuance in this struggle in modern society, but the abstraction of class struggle is a very useful one. 

Class struggle as the primary engine of change is one of the basic ideas of a Marxist materialist worldview. There's a semi-famous quote by Engels, "*all* past history was the history of class struggles; that these warring classes of society are always the products of the modes of production and of exchange." I do find this to be reductionist, but class analysis of history is often enlightening. It is certainly more convincing than the idealist theory of history which we were taught in school. We learned that history is succession of "Great Men" who Will the world in some way that they choose. We talk about great leaders and tyrants, as if their ideas and actions could exist without the society that constructed them. 

Class struggle explains why fighting capitalists with theories and ideas is not *actually* effective, while strikes are. Strikes stop production, which can severely hurt a business. The message of a strike may be "higher wages" or "shorter hours", but the medium for this message is the capitalist's bottom line.

But our society doesn't recognize class struggle, instead it invents its own classes like "lower", "middle", and "upper class." Arbitrary income lines don't identify the real material differences between individuals. You can find idealist concepts everywhere in our media and cultural consciousness, here are some examples:
- All we have to do is appeal to their conscience.
- A liberated *society* emerges from maximizing *individual* liberties.
- Peaceful protest is both the most moral and the most effective way of protesting.
- The economic success of an individual is based on some inherent property of their character, and that deserves a reward. 
- The problems in the world are because of a few bad apples in power, and if we just replaced them everything would start making sense. 

Perhaps you disagree with those, and maybe you agree that we have *structural* problems with our system. Identifying that is how I became attracted to the political Left, and perhaps it will have the same effect on you.
